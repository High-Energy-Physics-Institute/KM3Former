# KM3Former

KM3Former is an open-source package developed under the High Energy Physics Institute, Tbilisi, Georgia, as part of the KM3NeT (Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope) project. This repository contains a novel approach to muon reconstruction in neutrino telescopes using transformer-based deep learning models.

##Overview

The KM3Former package implements a transformer architecture tailored for processing KM3NeT detector data. It aims to improve the accuracy of muon trajectory reconstruction, particularly at high energies where traditional methods often struggle.

##Key features:

- Transformer-based model for muon direction reconstruction
- Optimized for KM3NeT detector data
- Scalable to large datasets
- Improved accuracy compared to classical reconstruction methods

## Results
Our research demonstrates significant improvements in muon reconstruction accuracy:

- Lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) across all studied energy ranges
- Particularly effective at high energies
- Ability to capture complex patterns in detector data
